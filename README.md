# DeepLearning: Understanding Clouds from Satellite Images By MaskRCNN and Unet
Authors: Jiaqi Tang, Jingjing Lin, Xinyi Ye, Yeqing Liu

## Objectives

Climate change has been a serious topic in recent years and even influenced political decision making.
A better physical understanding of clouds can help build better climate models as shallow clouds play a huge role in determining the Earth's climate. Although human eyes are pretty good at detecting features of different clouds, it is  challenging to build traditional rule-based algorithms to separate cloud features. Our work introduces a model for to classify cloud organization patterns from satellite images with MaskRCNN.


## Data

[Dataset click here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/understanding_cloud_organization/data)

The dataset includes 22184 satellite images of 1400 x 2100 px that contain certain cloud formations, with label names: Fish, Flower, Gravel, Sugar from NASA Worldview. Each image has at least one cloud formation, and can possibly contain up to all all four. The labels were created in a crowd-sourcing activity at the Max-Planck-Institite for Meteorology in Hamburg, Germany, and the Laboratoire de météorologie dynamique in Paris, France.
